        <h3>Bio</h3>
        <p>I was born in Sierra Vista Arizona. I grew up in a military family and moved several times during my childhood. I ended up in Seattle and I attended American InterContinental University where I earned my BAS in Criminal Justice, specializing in Homeland Security and Crisis Management. During college I worked in the security industry and worked as a supervisor until I graduated. I was accepted into a management development program through Penske Transportation, and I worked into an Assistant Branch Manager role. In 2020 I was subsequently laid off due to the Covid-19 pandemic. During this period, I worked temp roles, and took a chance and moved back to Southern Arizona. After reflecting on the direction, I wanted to take my career I decided to learn to code, and I enrolled in a bootcamp program through the University of Arizona in addition to my self-study to learn the skillset and prepare to enter a new industry. In my personal life I am married and have three very wonderful dogs. In my free time I train for running marathons, and I also enjoy playing guitar, retro games, and reading in my free time. </p>
